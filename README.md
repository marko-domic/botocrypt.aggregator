* [Quartz](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/) - Open source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java application.
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - Open-Source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful Web services.
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, Automate your logging variables, and much more.
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) - Modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers.
* [gRPC Mock](https://github.com/Fadelis/grpcmock) - A gRPC Java testing tool to easily mock endpoints of gRPC services for IT or Unit testing. The tool follows a similar DSL type of structure to HTTP mocking service WireMock.
* [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) - Open source testing framework for Java which allows the creation of test double objects (mock objects) in automated unit tests for the purpose of test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD).
* [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/) - Simulator for HTTP-based APIs. It constructs a HTTP server that we could connect to as we would to an actual web service. When a WireMock server is in action, we can set up expectations, call the service, and then verify its behaviors.

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Botocrypt Aggregator service and initializer on your local machine.

Before starting Aggregator, it needs to be initialized with required data. It could be done by execute the `main` method in the `com.botocrypt.aggregator.InitRunner` with environment variable `SPRING_PROFILE=init` class from your IDE, or use [Spring Boot Gradle plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins.html#build-tool-plugins-gradle-plugin) like so:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=init'
```

Starting a service could be done by executing the `main` method in the `com.botocrypt.aggregator.Application` class from your IDE or running Gradle plugin command:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```
